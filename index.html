        <p id="" class="">My name is Athavan and I am a grade 12 student at Agincourt Collegiate Institute with plans 
            to pursue engineering. I am looking for opportunities to work in the summer and am intrigued by the idea of working 
            at your soccer summer camp. I come with 10+ years of experience playing soccer along with 4+ years of coaching 
            and teaching soccer to the youth.
